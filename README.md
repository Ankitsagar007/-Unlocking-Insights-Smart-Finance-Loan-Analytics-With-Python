Unlocking-Insights-Smart-Finance-Loan-Analytics-With-Python
This project features a comprehensive row-wise dataset of financial loans, created for in-depth analysis using Python. Each row captures vital attributes of individual loan applications, including loan amount, repayment details, status, applicant demographics, purpose, employment length, home ownership, state, and date of issuance. The dataset is structured to enable diverse analyses—from tracking monthly and state-wise loan trends to uncovering repayment performance, risk patterns, and customer segmentation. This data was built to facilitate hands-on experience in data wrangling, aggregation, visualization, and exploration using Python libraries such as Pandas and Matplotlib. Ideal for developing dashboards, as well as financial and credit risk analytics, this dataset brings real-world financial insights to your fingertips.
